# Telecalling-Data-Analysis

In this project, we did analysis and visualization on Telecalling Dataset using Python and its libraries.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
1. **Pandas**- for providing fast, flexible, and expressive data structures. you can find instructions on how to install and use Pandas on your computer [here](https://pandas.pydata.org/getting_started.html).

2. **NumPy** - It is used for working with arrays and a wide variety of mathematical operations on arrays.Instructions of installing NumPy on your computer can be found [here](https://numpy.org/).

3. **Matplotlib** - used for creating 2D graphs and plots by using python scripts. Instruction to install and use can be found [here](https://matplotlib.org/).

4. **Seaborn** - it helps making statistical graphics in python. Instruction to install and use can be found [here](https://seaborn.pydata.org/).

5. **Juputer Notebook** - allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and narrative text.Instruction to install and use can be found [here](https://docs.jupyter.org/en/latest/).

### Installing

Once you have installed all the above mentioned libraries on your computer,

1. Clone the project to your computer by running `git clone https://github.com/cyboravidell/Telecalling-Data-Analysis` on your Git terminal.

2. In the directory of the folder `Telecalling-Data-Analysis` containing the files of the respository, open up the terminal and run `jupyter notebook`.

3. Once the Jupyter Notebook is open, click on the `Telecalling Analysis.ipynb`.

4. By clicking on the 'Telecalling Analysis.ipynb', you view all the analysis of the call logs and its visualization.

## Build With 

-[Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/try-jupyter/retro/notebooks/?path=Untitled.ipynb)- Web-based interactive computing platform.

-[Python3](https://www.python.org/doc/)- Python is very popular general-purpose interpreted, interactive, object-oriented and high-level programming language. 

### Tasks
 
We were asked to perform some tasks on the dataset for analysis and visualization. By using the already mentioned librarie and python programming language, we completed them.

Problem Statements -

You have been given a call log file of the telecommunication company which consist the From Number(10Digit) To Number(10Digit) and Call Duration (HH:MM: SS).
Company recently launched the new plan stating that,

-If the Call Duration is below 1 min then there will be no cost. (Free)

-If the Call Duration is above 1 min then it will be charged at 30paise/min

The tasks were:-

1. Find the distinct From Numbers for a day.

2. Find the distinct From Numbers who used the free plan. (Call Duration less than 1 min)

3. Find the total call duration with respect to From Number.

4. Find the total income for a day. (Cost to be considered for Call Duration greater 1 min)
